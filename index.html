                            • 2 large onions, peeled and halved
                            <br>• 1 large piece of ginger, about 4 inches, sliced lengthwise and smashed
                            <br>• 3-4 pounds of beef bones (such as oxtail, marrow, and knuckle bones)
                            <br>• 2-3 pounds of beef brisket or chuck, thinly sliced
                            <br>• 5-6 star anise pods
                            <br>• 6-8 whole cloves
                            <br>• 2-3 cinnamon sticks
                            <br>• 1 black cardamom pod (optional)
                            <br>• 1 tablespoon coriander seeds
                            <br>• 1 tablespoon fennel seeds
                            <br>• 1 tablespoon salt
                            <br>• 1-2 tablespoons sugar
                            <br>• ¼ cup fish sauce
                            <br>• 1 pound dried flat rice noodles (bánh phở)
                            <br>• Optional toppings: fresh herbs (cilantro, Thai basil, sawtooth herb), bean sprouts, lime wedges, sliced chili peppers, hoisin sauce, sriracha sauce

                            <i>1. Char the onions and ginger:</i> Place the halved onions and sliced ginger on a baking sheet and broil in the oven until they are charred on all sides, about 10-15 minutes.
                            <i><br>2. Prepare the broth:</i> In a large stockpot, add the beef bones and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to a simmer. Skim off any foam or impurities that rise to the surface. Add the charred onions and ginger, star anise, cloves, cinnamon sticks, black cardamom pod (if using), coriander seeds, and fennel seeds. Simmer the broth uncovered for at least 4-6 hours, occasionally skimming off any fat or impurities that accumulate on the surface.
                            <i><br>3. Season the broth:</i> Once the broth has simmered for several hours and has developed a rich flavor, season it with salt, sugar, and fish sauce to taste. Adjust the seasoning as needed to achieve a balanced flavor profile.
                            <i><br>4. Prepare the noodles:</i> While the broth is simmering, soak the dried rice noodles in hot water for about 20-30 minutes, or until they are soft but still slightly firm. Drain the noodles and rinse them under cold water.
                            <i><br>5. Prepare the beef:</i> Thinly slice the beef brisket or chuck against the grain into paper-thin slices. You can partially freeze the beef for easier slicing.
                            <i><br>6. Assemble the phở bowls:</i> Divide the soaked rice noodles among serving bowls. Top each bowl with slices of raw beef. Ladle the hot broth over the noodles and beef, ensuring that the beef cooks in the hot broth. The beef should turn opaque and cooked within a few minutes.
                            <i><br>7. Serve the phở:</i> Garnish the bowls of phở with fresh herbs, bean sprouts, lime wedges, sliced chili peppers, hoisin sauce, and sriracha sauce. Serve immediately and enjoy!

                                    <i>1.	Prepare the pork patties (chả):</i>
                                    <br>•	In a mixing bowl, combine ground pork, minced garlic, minced shallots, fish sauce, sugar, soy sauce, vegetable oil, and ground black pepper. Mix well until all ingredients are thoroughly incorporated.
                                    <br>•	Shape the pork mixture into small patties, about 1.5 inches in diameter.
                                    <br>•	Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the pork patties for 3-4 minutes on each side, or until cooked through and lightly charred. Alternatively, you can bake the patties in a preheated oven at 200°C (400°F) for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through.
                                            
                                    <br><i>2.	Prepare the marinade:</i>
                                    <br>•	In a bowl, combine fish sauce, sugar, rice vinegar, minced garlic, Thai bird's eye chili peppers (if using), and warm water. Stir until the sugar is dissolved.
                                    <br>•	Cook the rice vermicelli noodles:
                                    <br>•	Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the rice vermicelli noodles and cook according to package instructions, usually about 4-5 minutes, or until tender but still slightly firm. Drain the noodles and rinse them under cold water to stop the cooking process. Drain well.
                                            
                                    <br><i>3.	Assemble the bún chả bowls:</i>
                                    <br>•	Divide the cooked rice vermicelli noodles among serving bowls.
                                    <br>•	Arrange the grilled pork patties on top of the noodles.
                                    <br>•	Add fresh herbs (mint, cilantro, Thai basil), lettuce leaves, pickled carrots and daikon, sliced cucumbers, and sliced chili peppers (if using) to each bowl.
                                    <br>•	Serve with lime wedges and fish sauce dipping sauce on the side.
                                            
                                    <br><i>4.	Enjoy:</i>
                                    <br>•	To eat, dip the pork patties and noodles into the fish sauce marinade and enjoy with the fresh herbs and vegetables.
